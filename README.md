# blueshrimp2
This is an experimental JS client to talk to ArenaNet's API for its GuildWars 2 game. This is just a test project for my learning purposes.

To use it, you will need to:
- Have an account with ArenaNet (e.g. bought the GuildWars 2 game).
- Sign up and create an API key (see https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/API:API_key).
- Run the app (e.g. https://www.therealvan.com/blueshrimp2/).
- Enter the API key when prompted.

This app is purely client code and won't store your API key anywhere. You can check the code here.

How do you know the app is the same as the source code? You don't. Try it or leave it.
